-- Create two reports about book statistics.

-- Report 1: Show how many titles were published 
-- in each year.

-- Report 2: Show the five books that have been
-- checked out the most.

-- get list of the tables in the schema
SELECT name FROM sqlite_schema
WHERE TYPE = 'table';

-- get table info
PRAGMA table_info(_TableName_);
